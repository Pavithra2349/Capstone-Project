TIME SERIES ANALYSIS OF PATIENT ATTENDANCE AT JUMUIA HOSPITAL


I used some libraries for my analysis and plotting.

I used tseries package
forecast package
ggplot 2 package.

#MOTIVATION FOR THIS STUDY
Time series analysis on learning patient attendance pattern at Jumuia Clinic will help the emergency clinic develop on service delivery. In request to accomplish expansion of profit in the medical clinic the executives ought to have a model which shows direct variation between number of patients going to the facility and asset assignment by the medical clinic to serve those patients. This will be chronicled through; estimating the quantity of wellbeing laborers to serve patients on a specic timeframe,
assessing bedding limits and other clinical assets to serve patients at a given timeframe.

#HISTORY BACKGROUND OF THE SAMPLE

Sampling refers to the technique or the procedure the researcher would adopt
in selecting some units from which inferences about the population is drawn.
This study will use number of outpatient attendance(dependent variable) data
for the duration within August 2018 to November 2022(independent variable).Our
sample size was determined by availability of dataset from the hospital. Jumuia
Friends Hospital started storing their recorded in a computer system in the year
2018. For the previous years their records were stored manually(on paper), that
the reason why we were unable to get attendance for the previous years.

#Data collection and technique

The research will be based mainly on secondary data from all outpatient
clinics in Jumuia Friends Hospital. The data will be obtained from the records
found in Health Records Department in Jumuia Friends Hospital.


#RESEARCH QUESTION

Is patient attendance rate directly proportional to the input resources (eg nurses) allocated by the hospital mangement?
If the rate is not directly proportional I study attendance pattern and try to make them proportional by introducing model for estimation purposes.
